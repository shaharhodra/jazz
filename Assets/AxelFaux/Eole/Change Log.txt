CHANGELOG

_____
2.0.0
New ressources and patch

Added:
• A new "Quick Start" scene as example including a few technical tips.
• BIRP (Built-In) support: foliage shaders, including examples specificaly for this pipeline.
• [Shader] New ASE node "TreeBend".
• [Shader] Additional switch function in 'Vertex Foliage Offset' node (switch the 'Crush RT UV') and add a few sticky note tips.
• [Tool] Add "TreeBendEditor" tool for improved workflow with the TreeBend feature.
• [Foliage] add a new tree mesh/prefab (cypress).
• [UX] Add custom inspector for UX improvement with the additional Eole class (Crusher, and other class which have some controls on VFX/Particle System).

Changed:
• Nomenclature and directories have entirely changed to include the BIRP compatibility.
• [UX] ShaderGUI (material drawer) for UX improvement and include the new "TreeBend" feature.
• [Optimization] In "Foliage Color & Shading" node, the color variation mode "Height Position" and "Local Height Position" use Vertex Position instead off Pixel.
• [FX] VFX_FallLeaves (Visual Effect) example prefab has been replaced by FX_FallLeaves (Particle System) for a larger pipeline compatibility.
• [FX] VFX_RandomShockwaves (Visual Effect) example prefab has been replace by FX_RandomShockwaves for a larger pipeline compatibility.
• [URP Shader] Sea example only: fix refraction normals and reduce number of texture sample in gold ray shader.
• [Shader] Wind System now use 'Vertex Position' by default instead of 'Object Position' for each foliages.
• Prefabs are now instantiable from the tab 'GameObject/3D Object/Eole' (old path was GameObject/Eole).

Fixed:
• Color variation mode "Local Height Position" have a different mask when the object is rescaled.
• Sea example: Under Water Surface refaction don't use a nomal texture.
• Orientation of CrushCamera prefab is not correct when a new one is created.
• Shortcut Shift+S don't mark the crush manager inherited object when the CrushCamera is automatically set.

_____
1.2.0
New ressources and patch

Added:
• New examples with seaweeds under the water.

Changed:
• Arrange files and folders directory.
• Optimize the source textures (PSD are also replaced by PNG).
• Shader optimization (set most of the properties precision to half).
• All shaders examples can now cast shadows (enable/disable the shadow casting from the mesh renderer).

Fixed:
• Error in develoment build, missing a shader/'crush render texture'.

_____
1.1.2
Patch

Changed:
• EditorUtils: Remove the unused function FindObjectsWithSubstring

Fixed:
• Debug view: Turbulence mask is not visible when wind displacement is disabled.
• Missing "crush camera" reference while entering or exiting Play mode.
• Custom inspectors doesn't mark some references as dirty in some cases, including prefab instance.
• "Undo" action in the custom inspectors: do not work with texture references, and does not apply global properties after an "undo".
• MainCamera settings are overriden when it is set as "crush camera".
• When the MainCamera is set as "crush camera", the CameraCrushRenderTexture is instantiated even when already existing in the scene.

_____
1.1.1
Patch

Added:
• DOTS Instancing support.

Changed:
• Shaders model set to 4.5 (required for DOTS Instancing support).
• Changed script name EditorUtility to EditorUtils, to avoid confusion with Unity library.

Fixed:
• Shader variant stripping causing displacement issue in build.

_____
1.1.0
Minor patch and UX improvement

Added:
• Undo/redo support.
• A user action is now required with an editor popup window to confirm if a new CrushCamera should be instantiated when the reference is not valid.
• Foliage shaders (global shader properties) are now automatically initialized after Unity starts.

Changed:
• Rename VFXSetWindData to VFXSetWindProperties and improve the component flexibility.
• Rename the Eole toolbar script namespace.
• Delete GlobalShaderFoliageManager and its custom inspector script, as they were not used.

Fixed:
• Error "Assertion failed on expression: 'ShouldRunBehaviour()" while using the Eole refresh shortcut is now fixed.
• The prefab components don't execute anymore from the project folder / prefab mode, until the gameObject is in a valid scene, which could return some warnings.
